# Mastermind-Game

This is one of the first projects that I worked on outside of class. I followed along with a tutorial by Tech with Tim, listed here -

It was fun to be able to put the basics that I had learned in class towards something fun like this game, it was also interesting to 
see things such as for loops and if statements being used in a real world setting!
